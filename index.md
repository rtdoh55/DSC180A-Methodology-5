## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Brainstorm

### **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The way that we can filter out between multi-site and single site events in our experiment for charge deposits.

### **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I’d like to explore how different machine learning models to use for my classification because different models would have different complexities/would predict differently.

### **What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
One potential change would be having clearer expectations for how to carry out the project and what is exactly expected from us in our TA check ins.

### **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I’m interested in incorporating more physics background clarification because that would allow us to have a better understanding of the data and how to derive features from our data.
